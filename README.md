FreeAgent-backup
================

Automatically login to your FreeAgent account and download your data

*NOTE*: since FreeAgent moved to a queue system to export data this script no longer works. It can still be used to instigate a backup and you'll receive a mail when it's ready.

At some point I'll write something new to handle the delayed download. Maybe.

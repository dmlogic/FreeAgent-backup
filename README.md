FreeAgent-backup
================

Automatically login to your FreeAgent account and instigate a data export.

As of 0.3 this script does not attempt to dowload the generated backup as FreeAgent now operate a delayed file generation process.

However, their process will email you when the backup is generated which I've found to be sufficient to run a daily backup.
